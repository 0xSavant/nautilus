## Overview

* `cli`: The CLI for building & deploying Nautilus programs.
* `js`: The JavaScript client library.
* `py`: The Python client library.
* `solana`: The Rust crates.
    * `derive`: The macros that - leveraging the `nautilus-syn` crate - generate the code required.
    * `idl`: A crate of structs powered by `serde-json` that build an IDL JSON file **and it's relevant TypeScript and Python types**.
    * `src`: All traits and objects leveraged by the Nautilus framework. Also exposes `solana-program`, `spl-token`, and `mpl-token-metadata` dependencies.
    * `syn`: Code generation and parsing powered by Rust's `syn` and `quote` crates (`nautilus-syn`).
* `test-programs`: Full programs demonstrating Nautilus functionality.
